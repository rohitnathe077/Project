                            Service was placed under its own Commander-in-Chief. In 1955, each of the Commanders-in-Chief was
                            redesignated as the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) and the Chief of the
                            Air Staff (CAS).</li>

                            production of defence equipment. In November, 1965, the Department of Defence Supplies was created for
                            planning and execution of schemes for import substitution of defence requirements. These two Departments were
                            later merged to form the Department of Defence Production and Supplies. In 2004, the name of Department of
