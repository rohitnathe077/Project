                            The infusion of high technology based precision weaponry has enhanced the lethality 
                            of future warfare manyfold. The spectrum of threat ranges from the nuclear to the 
                            conventional and the assymetric, with terrorism emerging like a hydra-headed monster. 
                            Such are the trying environs in which a soldier operates.

                            The greatest binding force in the Indian Army remains unit cohesion and tradition. 
                            Truly heady is this mixture of Unit identification and traditions of sacrificial valour, 
                            handed down through centuries.
